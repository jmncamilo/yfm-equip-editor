## üìñ Introduction

With this tool, you can customize your Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories [SLUS-014.11] ROM. Want to make *Megamorph* and *Bright Castle* even more powerful? You can tweak the **exact boost** they give to your monsters!

>*This game has a simple system for equip cards: one value for Megamorph (which gets a special bonus +1000) and another for all the rest cards (like Dark Energy, Dragon Treasure, etc.). This tool lets you change these two main values but doesn't allow you to customize each card separately, so you can keep the game feeling like it always has.*
